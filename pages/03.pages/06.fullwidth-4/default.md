The history of Lepe probably goes back to Roman times, when Lepe may 
        have been a small port. There is evidence of a Roman road linking Lepe 
        to <a href="http://www.calmoreshow.org.uk/Histtotton.htm" target="_self" onFocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()">Eling</a> 
        at the head of Southampton Water.</p>
      <p class="style1 style6">The origins of the name Lepe, according to Professor Richard Coates, 
        President of the <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/ins/epns/" target="_self" onFocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()">English 
        Place Name Society</a>, is:</p>
      <blockquote class="style3 style6"> 
        <p class="style4">&quot;Old English 'hliep(e)'='leaping place', especially for deer; 
          a fence to allow deer to jump where other animals are restrained. A 
          common name type in forest areas. Possibly a jumpable stream, or other 
          such crossing place.&quot;</p>

      <p class="style1 style6">Lepe (using its original spelling 'Leape' or 'Leap') has appeared in 
        <a href="maps.html" target="_self" onFocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()">old maps</a> since 
        1575.</p>
      <span class="style1 style6">The Ship Inn, an ale-house in the mid 18th century, forms the basis of the 
      current Lepe House. Nearby Gardener's Cottage (Grade II listed) probably 
      existed at that time as well. As shown in Thomas Milne's 1791 map, there 
      were certainly other dwellings at Lepe during the latter part of the 18th 
      century when Lepe was briefly a site for naval shipbuilding.      </span>
      <h5 class="heading style1 style6">Shipbuilding</h5>
      <p class="style1 style6">Moody Janverin was asked by the Admiralty to create a shipyard at Lepe 
        in 1744.</p>
      <p class="style1 style6"> The gravel beach with the low cliff behind provided him with the site 
        for the building of the Greenwich (1,053 tons), which was launched in 
        1748. This was followed in 1749 by the 28-gun <a href="http://www.anthro.fsu.edu/research/uw/research/ships/dog_island/research_design99.html" target="_self" onFocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()"> 
        Fowey</a> (513 tons). Janverin also took over the building of the Woolwich 
        which was being built by John Darley at nearby <a href="http://www.bucklershard.co.uk/" target="_self" onFocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()">Buckler's 
        Hard</a>.</p>
      <p class="style1 style6"> Janverin left Lepe in 1749 and the site remained unused until 1763 when 
        Henry Adams, who was building ships at Buckler's Hard, built the 64-gun 
        Europe (1,379 tons) at the yard. The Europe was launched in 1765.</p>
      <h5 class="style1 style6">Coastguard station </h5>
      <p class="style1 style6">A coastguard station was built on the  Lepe Estate to combat the smuggling activities 
        in the region shortly after the modern-day <a href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home.htm" target="_self" onFocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()">Coastguard</a> 
        was formed in 1822. Completed in 1828, the  Coastguard 
        Cottages (Grade II listed) and the Watch House remain largely unchanged 
        today. These appear in <a href="http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/hantsmap/hantsmap/grnwood2/grw52f.htm" target="_self">C &amp; J Greenwood's 1826 map of Hampshire</a> and 
        are clearly shown below in the 1871 Ordnance Survey map of the area. 
        The commander of the first crew appointed as coastguards was Lieutenant 
        Hodge.</p>

      <h5 class="style1 style6">Current ownership </h5>
        
      <p class="style1 style6">Lepe Estate has been in the ownership of the same family since it was 
        acquired, together with Exbury Estate, from the Mitford family in 1879. 
        Inchmery 
        House was sold to Lionel de Rothschild in 1916. He bought the remainder of Exbury Estate, including Exbury House, in 1919. Lepe House has been substantially added 
        to over the years, particularly between 1895 and 1925. </p>
      <h5 class="style1 style6">World War II</h5>
      <p class="style1 style6"> The House was requisitioned by the Navy in 1943 and became the Headquarters 
        of the J-Force Assault Group for the West Solent embarkations before the 
        D-Day Normandy landings. The concrete hard and access ramps, which enabled 
        tanks to be loaded onto landing craft, remain in evidence on the foreshore. 
        Perhaps the best description of Lepe, and nearby Exbury, at this time 
        is to found in the novel <A HREF="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1842322869/lepeestate-21" target="_self" onFocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()">Requiem for a Wren</A>
