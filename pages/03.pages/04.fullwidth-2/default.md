Lepe Estate, including the beach, is private property and access is restricted to the public footpaths.

There is [public footpath along the beach](http://www.visitukheritage.gov.uk/servlet/com.eds.ir.cto.servlet.CtoLandMapServlet?ID=507), which is part of a walk extending from Lepe Country Park in the east to Inchmery in the west. There is also a footpath down to the beach from the Exbury/Inchmery crossroads along Gipsy Lane. The public footpath to East Hill Farm can be accessed by a permissive footpath across the field from the western overflow car park of Lepe Country Park.

Other than the footpaths mentioned above, the beach and all other parts of the Estate are private property.
